Bro TCP Log Writer Plugin
=========================

A Bro log writer that sends logging output using TCP, optionally
using TLS.

Many thanks to the ncsa/bro-zeromq-writer which I used as a model
for this plugin.


Usage
-----

```sh
$ bro-pkg install https://github.com/fkmclane/bro-tcp-writer
```


### Basic Usage

```bro
redef LogTCP::host = "127.0.0.1";
redef LogTCP::tcpport = 1337;
```


## Custom Filters

Custom filters allow you to configure the TCP writer on a per-filter
basis. Note that all configuration items must be strings and are
converted to the appropriate type at runtime.

```bro
@load Writer/TCP

event bro_init() {
	local remote_filter: Log::Filter = [
		$name = "remote-tcp",
		$writer = Log::WRITER_TCP,
		$interv = 0 sec,
		$config = table(["host"] = "127.0.0.1", ["tcpport"] = "1337", ["retry"] = "T")
	];

	Log::add_filter(Notice::LOG, remote_filter);
}
```


### Global Options

```bro
## TCP connection details. Retry will cause the
## writer to not throw an error when a connection fails
## and simply keep retrying. TLS negotiates TLS with the
## TCP server. Cert is an optional path to a trusted CA
## or server certificate. Key is sent to the remote
## server every time a connection is made.
LogTCP::host = "";
LogTCP::tcpport = 1337;
LogTCP::retry = F;
LogTCP::tls = F;
LogTCP::cert = "";
LogTCP::key = "";

## Optionally ignore any specified :bro:type:`Log::ID` from being sent to
## TCP.
LogTCP::excluded_log_ids = {};

## If you want to explicitly only send certain :bro:type:`Log::ID`
## streams, add them to this set.  If the set remains empty, all will
## be sent.  The :bro:id:`LogTCP::excluded_log_ids` option
## will remain in effect as well.
LogTCP::send_logs = {};
```
